	Angela: He was always just wasting it.
	Angela: She could have been so much better with someone else, yet she spent 50 years with him... => SisterOfWife_interrogation1

- Thanks for your information.
	Angela: Of course, my love. I hope you don't think I killed him. I didn't like him, but I would never do such thing.
