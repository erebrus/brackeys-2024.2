#if the player solves the crime correctly.
So this is it. Samantha was standing between all those murders.
	Her grief drove her insane, causing her to avenge for her husband's death.
The shady businesses he was investing it, due to Tom, Frank and Andrew's influence, made him mess up with the wrong people.
	She never got over it and couldn't stand the fact that she would never celebrate 50th marriage anniversary with him.
Thank you for playing!
