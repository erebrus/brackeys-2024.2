#if the player solves the crime correctly.
So this is it. Samantha was the one behind all those murders.
	Her grief drove her insane, causing her to seek vengeance for her husband's death.
The shady businesses he was investing in, due to Tom, Frank and Andrew's influence, made him mess with the wrong people.
	She never got over it and couldn't stand the fact that she would never celebrate her own 50th anniversary with him.
Thank you for playing!
