The mansion is getting closer as you drive. 
Sunrays reflect in the tall windows, some birds fly over the red rooftop.
It's the perfect setting for a few days at your partner's family house.
Celebrating the 50th anniversary of their wedding. 
You can just relax from work and enjoy the lavish mansion for a bit.

Your parnter: So this is it. My family house. Everyone is here already, so feel free to get to know them.
I'm tired after the trip, so I'll just go and relax for a bit with some nice vintage. 
See you later, love.
You: Alright, I'll go and introduce myself to everyone.
