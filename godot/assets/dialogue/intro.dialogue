~ the_mansion

The mansion is getting closer as you drive. 
Sunrays reflect in the tall windows, some birds fly over the red rooftop.
It's the perfect setting for a few days at your partner's family house.
Celebrating the 50th anniversary of the wedding. 
You can just relax from work and enjoy the lavish mansion for a bit. => END
